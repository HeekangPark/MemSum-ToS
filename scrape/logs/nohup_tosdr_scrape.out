as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.', 'These sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.', 'CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:', 'In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.', 'This information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).', 'commercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).', 'categories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).', 'characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).', 'internet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.', 'geolocation information.', 'professional or employment related data (such as title).', 'and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.', 'CCPA description of uses of California personal information:', 'In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.', 'The extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.', 'CCPA “sale” of California personal information', 'Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.', 'We don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.', 'However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.', 'The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.', 'Some take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.', 'If you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.', 'As we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.', 'In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.', 'In the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.', 'However, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.', 'Regardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.', 'California Privacy Rights', 'This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.', 'California law may permit you to request that we:', 'Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.', 'the categories of sources of such information.', 'the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.', 'and the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.', 'Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.', 'Delete certain information we have about you.', 'Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.', 'You also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).', 'You also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.', 'To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.', 'You can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.', '(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.', 'Similar exceptions are common in other laws.)', 'To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.', 'Alternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.', 'No

“service provider” for such data under the CCPA.', 'CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:', 'In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.', 'This information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).', 'commercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).', 'categories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).', 'characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).', 'internet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.',

collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.', 'The extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.', 'CCPA “sale” of California personal information', 'Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.', 'We don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.', 'However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.', 'The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.', 'Some take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.', 'If you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.', 'As we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.', 'In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.', 'In the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.', 'However, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.', 'Regardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.', 'California Privacy Rights', 'This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent
